# UBC CS Procmail filters

UBC CS has several different versions of SpamAssassin installed, making it
difficult to configure the global site version to run machine that runs
procmail.
remote.cs.ubc.ca has version 3.4.2, while gypsytears.cs.ubc.ca uses 3.3.1, and
they're configuration are apparently incompatible.

I've installed SpamAssassin locally on my home directory which should avoid
these problems.

- Run `init-spamassassin.sh` on `remote.cs.ubc.ca` to get the environment
  variables setup to use my version of SpamAssassin.
  This will install environment variables in `.bashrc`.
- Add the contents of `crontab` to your crontab.
- Add the contents of `.procmailrc` to your `.procmailrc`, preferably near the
  top.
- Save messages to the `Junk` folder to train the spam filter, and autoblock
  that address; save messages to `CSFILTER` to only use train the spam filter
  but not autoblock.
- Move messages out of `CSFILTER` to any other folder to get them retrained as
  ham.
- Maybe uncomment some of the supervision request patterns.
